# AI-powered-book-writing

AI-powered-book-writing is a powerful tool that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help users generate a complete book based on the inputs they provide. This project uses OpenAI and Google Gemini models to create creative and engaging book content. You simply need to provide the book's title, subtitle, writing style, language, and desired length, and the AI automatically generates a well-structured book.

The main goal of this tool is to deliver high-quality, readable, and engaging content, which is automatically generated using AI models.

Key Features:
AI-powered content generation: The tool generates book content based on user inputs.
Multiple formats: AI-generated content can be saved in both TXT and PDF formats.
Highly customizable: Users can specify the title, subtitle, writing style, language, and word count/page length for the book.
Advanced AI Models: Content is generated using Google Gemini and OpenAI models.
Chunk-based PDF generation: The content is divided into smaller chunks and saved as a readable PDF.

Technologies Used:
OpenAI API: Used for generating AI-based book content.
Google Gemini API: Utilized for enhancing the generated book content.
LangChain: Handles the AI workflows and models.
LangGraph: Manages the AI workflows using a graph-based approach.
ReportLab: Used to generate the PDF files.

How It Works:
User Input: The user provides the bookâ€™s title, subtitle, writing style, language, and word count or page length.
AI Content Generation: The input is formatted, and the content is generated using Google Gemini and OpenAI models.
Save Content: The generated content is saved in TXT and PDF formats.
